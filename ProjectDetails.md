# Roguelike 2D Medival Style (probably) early concept
------
Short roguelike 2d platformer (sth like Rogue Legacy / Shovel Knight)
Knight as a main playable character
Sword / Lance or Halberd as a weapon (probably just one - there will be no choice)
Simple attack mechanics + dash / double jumps etc
Few types of enemies (Not all of them have to actually aim for the player ; they can just walk around and smash the ground f.e / flying objects to avoid)
Some platforms that will become invisible (on touch)  and stuff like that
It would be awesome to do some kind of boss fight
Several "rooms" with encounter; 
If I will have enough time and my knowledge will let me - there can be some fixes / upgrades / new stuff
------
Textures / Blocks  / Design - No more than week ( ~ 3 days - I hope so)
Making Levels - 4-7 days 
Designing + Animating main character + monsters - depends (lets say it will be max 1 week)
Making some music (yup - I have no idea how but I will the solution ^^) - would be great if there will be different music for boss fight + implementing some sounds for jumping/falling/moving/attacking  (Im not sure if its a good idea but I will find out) - 1 week
Making Player Controller - 2 weeks or even more 
Coding everything else - infinity
------
If something will come to my mind I will note it
